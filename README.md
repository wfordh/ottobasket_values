# ottobasket_values

## TO DO:
- rewrite and modularize the scripts
- incorporate games played and projected games played into calculations
- write the README
- do the calculations for roto leagues
- make a streamlit app
  - allow users to input minutes projections for individual players?
- have full strength and current values to help price players who are injured or just back
  - current minutes: save last 10 days and get min / max / avg from that to contextualize
- use SGP instead of z-scores for roto dollar values
- future applications of projections:
  - lineup optimizer
  - matchup analysis
- add validation to make sure DRIP / DARKO dfs have not changed structure
